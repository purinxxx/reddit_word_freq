There absolutely is. But I'm not going to tell you how you can do it. Study the material, dumbass. 
As far as I know there's no open source software for this. You'll have to write it yourself or hire someone to.

Both the YouTube app and the web page already have this functionality, so you better have an idea with something more to it.
Thank you so much. I've already done it manually though. I edited 199 tracks by hand lol
You can do this in Mp3Tag. You would select the file or files, then go to Action -> Actions Quick. Then choose Replace with regular expression. Then choose the field you want to modify. If you want to remove x amount of characters at the beginning then put the following in the Regular expression box: `^.{x}`  To remove characters from the end, put the following in the Regular expression box: `.{x}$`  x should be replaced with the number of characters and the replace box should be blank in both cases.

Oh wow how convenient, thanks man! I had no idea!
The Youtube app can already do this.
You just gave me an idea for an app
Use remote desktop to connect to your laptop through your desktop pc and use all the devices attached to it. 
YouTube.com/TV on the laptop, everyone else can use YouTube.com/pair to connect (or the youtube app on their smartphone).
I'm looking for a software solution.
It goes without saying that I am thankful for any help, but please, don't misunderstand the question. All I want is **to see that specific app in order to see that specific list of options**. I am sure that the app is, was or should be famous in its field, but... I spent a lot of time checking various hashing apps, but found nothing similar, no alternative... it's a mystery...
The Chromecast can do this, anyone can add videos to it's queue.
I understand what you're asking for and am merely offering an alternative, the list of hashes that any language supports natively is usually quite comprehensive but does depend on the system it's running on.  In terms of salts, they are just random strings.  Quick python script:      import hashlib as h          print ("Hashes available on this system:")     for x in h.algorithms_available:         print (" - " + x)          hash = input("Select a hash: ")     string = input("String to hash: ")          hasher = h.new(hash)     hasher.update(string.encode('utf-8'))     print(hasher.hexdigest())

You could say no in a more diplomatic way. It's not like they just wasted 30 minutes of time. They are just trying to help. Just sayin...
I really like Google Hangouts, can't believe I never thought of using that!  Thank you so much! 
This seems to be the best option so far!  Thanks for your quick reply! 
Wow!  Thank you for all of the options and for your reply! 
Thank you so much!  This is exactly what I was looking for! 
Of course not. HashTab does not even fit my description. (For example, there is no salt/hmac options). That app was much more advanced.
I suggest [HashTab](http://implbits.com/products/hashtab/).
IGATE infrastructure management system optimizes the performance of your data resources along-with security and high productivity.
I am not asking how to write hashing scripts, I am asking about the name of that specific app. Its list of items was really impressive and comprehensive, and I just want to see it again.
Hashing functions are so readily available in every language it might be easier for you to write your own small script that does this.  https://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html would be a good place to start if you're familiar with Python.
Depends on your preference.  * [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) is probably the closest match to what you're looking for: a light(ish)-weight Messenger alternative. * There are lots of online options; some are free, while others aren't.  [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and [HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com/) come to mind (between those two, Telegram's probably closest to what you'd want). * IRC is the traditional answer here.  The easiest approach would be to join an existing server and "query" each other to establish a one-to-one chat, but it's also possible to setup your own and use that (hell, maybe even talk your employer into setting up its own IRC server for internal use, if they don't already have one).  [Lots of clients available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients); Pidgin happens to be one of them.

Yep, your ISP will see any traffic as PIA while the VPN is on, and when it's off, they could choose to review the sites you're visiting. 
Love pidgin, been using it for around 6+ years, maybe more
[Pidgin.](https://pidgin.im/) It supports accounts from      AIM,     Bonjour,     Gadu-Gadu,     Google Hangouts,     Groupwise,     ICQ,     IRC,     MSN,     MXit,     SILC,     SIMPLE,     Sametime,     XMPP,     Yahoo!,     Zephyr.
I'm confused. GoPro, Starwood Hotels, et. al. are not bundling SSL into the products they're selling, they're simply using SSL to send information and arrange transactions. Do holders of cash register patents have a similar case against brick and mortar merchants like Barnes &amp; Noble, Dick's sporting goods, Best Buy, et. al.?
I'm using [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) at the moment and I'm quite pleased with it. My task manager reports that it consumes less than 9 MB of RAM which is great if true. The interface is clean and modern and it runs just about everywhere. There are some concerns about the quality of its cryptography so if you have privacy concerns you might want to look elsewhere.
If you're both on Facebook or Google Hangouts, you can go to messenger.com or hangouts.google.com, respectively. That is, assuming you're employer isn't blocking these sites through a proxy ...
That is why everyone needs to counter sue and blast this shit away for the rest of us

Unfortunately, I don't know of any free program. Also, PM'd you.
I'm happy using Pazera Free Audio Extractor. I think it's a GUI front for ffmpeg.     I just drag and drop a whole folder full of .avi .mp4 .webm or whatever other format, select the audio channel to extract (transcoding is also possible) and it just zips through it.
FFmpeg will do the trick and is an awesome tool, but if you'd prefer something with a GUI, you can always just 'drag and drop' the .flv file into [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/) and then go to File > Export and export as .mp3. 
Well, I more want it in an mp4 or mkv format; imgs take a while for to upload to YouTube (and my upload speed is around 0.58 mbps), but a program like that should do for now. Are there any programs like that which are free?
handbrake?  (not windows only, but it can change video formats)

I'm in recruitment and I personally use an RSS reader. Most job posting services support RSS so I get almost 100% of my leads piped in to one place. 
I'm going to keep trying. I'll let you know. 
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) can do this. For example:      ffmpeg -i input_file.flv output_file.mp3  You can use any output extension to get the format you want, or the same one as the source to prevent quality loss. 
I'm really happy that you got it to convert, however there isn't any way to get it to only play one of the 2 angles?
Probably a little more than 1/7. If you're happy with that, I can finish the rest.

Well, if you're encrypting the folder you're gonna have to decrypt it. It seems obvious but I think it sounds like you'd rather just have a password protected directory.  Here's quite a sneaky way that just sort of hides the folder: http://www.howtogeek.com/105633/how-to-create-a-password-protected-folder-without-any-extra-software/  
Oh, that. I'm dumb. I thought I had included it in the link. Here's the whole link with the key: https://mega.nz/#!IlYV0QCZ!cm2D2bUyKurIywZw-mq33VTOKoyFrhG4Fcb6wYd662Y
[Mega is asking me for a decryption key.](http://i.imgur.com/XGm0sAJ.jpg)
It's not encrypted. What I did was mount the image, then demux the separate EVO (Enhanced VOB) files with ffmpeg, e.g.      ffmpeg -i /Volumes/AARRSSTWWTSSRRAA/HVDVD_TS/HV001T08.EVO -c:v copy -map 0:0 video.264 -c:a copy -map 0:1 audio1.ac3 -c:a copy -map 0:2 audio2.ac3  This just splits the video and two audio streams into 3 separate files. I wanted to do this since I didn't know what was what. There are also 2 subtitle streams in the first EVO that don't show up in the others. According to the nfo file, these just blank out the information at the top of the screen.  Anyway, to answer your second question, the multi-angle feature was used so you can switch between AARRSSTW and WTSSRRA at any point. As far as I can tell, one of them has the scenes ordered from shortest to longest, and one is the opposite. Unfortunately, using separate "angles" makes it much harder to rip. If it were instead 2 separate titles, I think it would be straightforward. Angles are encoded in a single stream, alternating back and forth. A proper player or ripper could handle this with no problem—and such tools exist for regular DVDs—but HD-DVD–compatible tools are hard to find. If you want to see how it looks, you can watch the file I linked.
Something must not be working right on my end. I double click the exe and nothing happens.

What's the decryption key? And thank you so much! When you say it jumps back and fourth between 2 angles, how does it affect the video?
Divx and flvto come to mind
I've been messing around with this. I've made some progress, but I'm not sure how helpful it's been. As you've seen, HD-DVD support was never great for a lot of tools, and now it's not much of a priority. I haven't found anything that can tackle the whole image (although Apple's DVD Player seems to play it pretty well), but I did manage to demux the EVO files. They all have 1 h264 video stream and 2 ac3 audio streams. There's (at least) one problem though: I can't find any multi-angle aware HD-DVD rippers, so the video jumps back and forth between the 2 angles. The output from one of the EVO files is [here](https://mega.nz/#!IlYV0QCZ) if you want to take a look.

This is what I use. It lets you download any resolution (even 4k, if they offer it) and extract audio too. [Its webpage is here](https://www.4kdownload.com/products/product-videodownloader). Its free with ads, and if you purchase it you can download entire playlists. 
I don't understand where it is intended to be used.  I wouldn't download and run random .exe from SourceForce.  Don't see a license indicated.

**EDIT 2: SKIP THIS AND LOOK DOWN**  Install Python 3 from www.python.org, and make a note of the directory where it's installed. Then open a command line (Win+R "cmd") and type the following:      PATH=%PATH%:<YourPythonDirectory>     python <YourCopyOfYoutube-dl> --extract-audio <YourVideoURL>  I'm not sure about this because I prefer working in Cygwin, but Cygwin's completely overkill for just `youtube-dl`. This *should* work. I think. Maybe. It won't harm anything, give it a go.  **EDIT**: I know you can also install `youtube-dl` with `pip`, but I'm even less sure about that working.  **EDIT 2**: Actually, there's a [Windows .exe file](https://yt-dl.org/latest/youtube-dl.exe) available. Just download that and make sure you're in the same directory as `youtube-dl.exe` when you run it. If it goes into your Downloads, for example, do `cd Downloads`.
What exactly isn't working?
I want to use this but am on Win7, I'm having trouble getting it to work, mind elaborating real quick?
you can use 4k Video Downloader, it's free

Yes it would disconnect you because the itinerary from your computer to the servers will change because your public IP is different.  See: http://smartunblock.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/vpn-diagram.png  For the server your public IP is your VPN provider. PIA is a simple vpn provider so all the traffic from your network adapter is embedded in the VPN tunnel.  What you can do to avoid that is using a virtual machine with the VPN. So the traffic from your computer and the one from the VM will coexist without disconnecting you.
[`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)` --extract-audio <YourVideoURL>` should do the trick.
Do you have access to the program that's putting files in that folder in the first place?  If you do you could modify it to notify you as soon as it transfers a file.  You can also use email to send text messages as long as you know the domain of your cell phone provider.  For Example for AT&T you can use: (PHONE NUMBER HERE)@txt.att.net So if my number was 123 it would be 123@txt.att.net and if I sent an email to that domain, your phone would receive it as a text message.   So the existing script you have can be modified to email your phone number@yourprovider's domain.net and then bam you've got it done.   You could just update the rate by which it checks the folder to be really often and send an email to that address.  Why does it need to be instant anyways?  Is there something that needs to be done immediately with the files?  It can't possibly be your job to stare at a computer screen and manipulate some file the INSTANT it arrives...  .   Edit:  Here's a list of SMS Domains from carriers most people use:  AT&T: number@txt.att.net  T-Mobile: number@tmomail.net  Verizon: number@vtext.com  Sprint: number@messaging.sprintpcs.com or number@pm.sprint.com  Virgin Mobile: number@vmobl.com  Tracfone: number@mmst5.tracfone.com  Metro PCS: number@mymetropcs.com  Boost Mobile: number@myboostmobile.com  Cricket: number@sms.mycricket.com  Nextel: number@messaging.nextel.com  Alltel: number@message.alltel.com  Ptel: number@ptel.com  Suncom: number@tms.suncom.com  Qwest: number@qwestmp.com  U.S. Cellular: number@email.uscc.net
I use clipconverter.cc (they have or they had a browser extension, as well).
I can already do that but i don't check my email frequently, also i need it to be instant, as in right as it updates i need an alarm, i was sure people already created it since its such an easy concept, thanks for replying either way
You could write a script that checks the folders contents every 5 mins and if a file is added it sends an email.  I think that would work for what you're asking, but I don't think a program exists for this.
.... and boom goes the dynamite
For most common VPNs it's You -> VPN -> Location you want -> VPN -> You. If you want a VPN for downloading things, you could try Tor. But yes, if you connect it while your connected to something else it will interrupt your connection. I'm sure someone can elaborate much more, but I'm on shitty mobile and typing annoys me.

Woah I have never heard about agile software development. Seems to be the modern way, which I natively like as a '92 born. Will definitely do more research on that tomorrow. (edit: I even have thought about how I would manage a team of hired coders, with somewhat similar ideas, but came to the conclusion that they will know best ;D)    So I've got one more question: What is more common, me contacting the team, or the team contacting me? Therefore, would I usually publish a call for proposals? Are there big websites for this?  Or would I look for the teams? If so, are there some big *market websites* where I should look on team profiles? I don't know any of these, but it seems likely to me. I lack the jargon to google it.

Nice trainee project.
That's very kind of you, thank you. I have a Patreon page (www.Patreon.com/OptiKey), but it's a monthly subscription thing, so don't worry. I appreciate your message though.
I think if the guess is not close, it should be less. Graphics don't matter a lot and there's very few features overall. Luckily, I have access to that kind of money.   The more I think about it, the more I agree to #3. So I would hire a company that employs coders, maybe in harmonised teams? How does that work, are there websites where I can post a call for proposals? Or do I need to contact them directly? How do I make sure nobody *steals* my idea if I post it publicly?   4 seems very good. Although I don't feel qualified yet to determine what's the best fit. I hope that will be in their proposal?   So how does a call for proposals look? Database, multiple OS apps, web/PC interface, simple graphics, professional - they can not make a bid on that information I guess.
Wow, I nearly read two words of that before the article flew off screen for some reason and I got another one in before the newsletter signup covered the whole page.

I think it's only worth it if you want to experiment with electronics as well using the GPIO.  Otherwise just use it as a media center or server, and program on a normal computer that's much faster and easier to use.  Where do I buy this for $5? Anyone have a link?
I just came across this post because I was browsing the top posts of some subreddits,  so I'm a bit late, but it's really awesome what you're doing. I net this helped thousands of people who couldn't afford anything else before and you're doing it completely for free AND open source, is there a link where people can donate you some money? I don't have that much myself right now but I'm thinking if everyone could just give you like 5 bucks you can afford something nice for yourself, which you obviously deserve. 
I think i've tried TinyTask and its glitchy.  It doesn't always click and it lags out clicking the recorded places innacurately.

Why buy a $5 dollar computer to learn the basics of programming when I already have a much more powerful computer that I can learn the basics of programming with?
Already tried, does not have a loop feature.
That was my first idea as well - Excel 2003 is quite fine. (Excel 2000 is also good, but only works up to Win XP).

"I imagine something like 4 people, 4 months, but that's just a wild guess."  1. Yes.  That's an absolutely wild guess.   2. If your guess is even close to correct, you're looking at roughly a $100,000 project. If you don't have access to that kind of money, you should probably shouldn't spend too much time on this.  3. Based on your lack of technical skills, I would not recommend hiring directly, unless you bring in a technical co-founder.  4. If you hire a firm: (a) Get several quotes & have several discussions.   (b) You should not be looking for the lower bidder, but rather the best fit. (c) Whatever bid you get, double it.  Software inherently has uncertainty.

Thanks for asking! I've had it working for a while on Windows 10 but I've been adding different things and been sidetracked with a new job I just started. I will try to upload a working version very shortly for you! I'll reply again soon once I have it up
Well, when someone says to me "I need an app", the first question that springs to mind is "What can your app do that a website can't?".  One of the requirements is live updating so an Internet connection would be needed anyway.  Would it be possible to do a website instead, with a decent interface for the mobile crowd?  That would take care of iOS, Android and Windows without having to port code.  How big a database?  How many entries and how many fields for each entry?  Do you need some sort of lookup facility to check street or email addresses or confirm credit card numbers?  THE most important thing to do when starting a project is a websearch to find out if it's been done before.  If it has, find out if it's been done with a licence you can use.
Ninite supports Greenshot. You can probably download it with that.
Take a look at Blue Iris  http://blueirissoftware.com.   I've used it for years.   
I don't know about IDM, but you can use [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) for that. If you prefer a GUI, there's a Windows-only one [here](http://hexotic.net/software/ytdownloader/) and a cross-platform one [here](http://hexotic.net/software/ytdownloader/). I haven't tried them, but I've seen them mentioned around here.
Yeah I'd uninstall VLC and see what happens when you install the [64bit version](http://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.1/win64/vlc-2.2.1-win64.exe) (assuming your system is 64bit).

NICE SHARING
I'll try to do that. Thanks for the suggestion :) 
I tried it but i'm too stupid and lazy to config the scripts...need something easier that can just record the mouse clicks and then i can replay it in a loop ._.  I've found a few like that, but they are all paid..
Yeah, it looks similar to that, with .EVOs. I used another converter called [Videncoder](http://sourceforge.net/projects/videncoder/), but it also didn't work, however I noticed it does the same thing as Handbreak; it sets the duration to 0:00:00, even though the video is intended to be about 2 hours long. Why is it doing this?
Sorry, I don't know what to try next.  Does the structure look like so: http://www.doom9.org/index.html?/dvd-structure.htm ?   (But with EVOs rather than VOBs, I presume : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOB)
Yeah, that. I just want a one-click context menu.
this?  http://i.imgur.com/7ScgSFE.png  you define the default option in settings, the checkbox merely lets you change or add an option per capture. Iirc you can also set it to auto-take one option (my default is "upload"), but I like the option to choose whether to edit, save locally, or upload, or all 3. But I agree the options in general need streamlining, they're all over the place
I renamed it to an ISO. It gave me a message saying:      MakeMKV v1.9.7 win(x64-release) started     Failed to open disc
[autohotkey](https://autohotkey.com/)
I had the same issue for days but you can still get it from CNET. Just be careful that you download/install only Greenshot. 
I think so.  The File > Open files menu has a few file types, including IFO and ISO.  If the IMG file is uncompressed, then it is the same as an ISO, then MakeMKV should work OK on the IMG file (perhaps rename it). http://www.ehow.com/info_8075301_differences-between-iso-img-files.html
Shame about the UI, though, if you want to manually select whether to upload, save, or copy each time. ShareX does it with this clunky big checkbox selector thing.
I'm fine with an .mkv file. However, is MakeMKVV compatible with .IMGs?  ***EDIT***: It doesn't seem to work with .IMGs.  ***EDIT 2***: I got it to detect the disc, using /u/wolfcry0's method of using WinCDEmu, but it doesn't allow me to do anything after that. 
Try [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/) to extract the contents of the ISO to an MKV file, then Handbrake to re-encode / convert to mp4.  Basically, MakeMKV just copies all of the DVD contents into an MKV file (it doesn't re-encode or trans-code the video), and that MKV file should be easier to deal with in Handbrake.
There is more than one of them, and it doesn't have a lot of memory, compared to the .EVO and .BUP files. If I open that file, Handbreak would open the others?  ***EDIT***: I opened one of the .ifo files, but it did nothing. I also, tried to convert one of the .EVO files, but there weren't any audio tracks associated with it. When i opened the .img in its entirety, there was an audio track associated with it.  ***EDIT 2***: I opened the folder that contained the contents of the .img and it shot me with an error message.
Hmm, it's been a long time since I've worked with DVD images, but I think if you open the VIDEO_TS.IFO file in handbrake it should work.
Word! ShareX is head and shoulders better. 
I was able to open the other file using Handbreak, and it converted without any problems. Anyways, I downloaded and installed the program, and I found that it is comprised of multiple .EVO, .IFO, and .BUP files. What do I do next? I want to convert them into a single .mp4, .avi, .mkv, or something. 
plz visit
I'm seeing it say there are four comments total at this time. Looks to be a shadowban? 
Well handbrake probably can't open it because it's an image file, not a video file.  [WinCDEmu](http://wincdemu.sysprogs.org/) will mount img files so you can see what's in it.
Well, I have nothing to mount it on (you can only to mount them to discs if I'm not mistaken, and I don't have any over 700mb (my file is much bigger)), so idk most likely some sort of video filetype. I was able to successfully convert an .img file using that program earlier. However, that file did have more than 1 "chapter" (which is what Handbrake calls them), but the one I'm have trouble with didn't. Could that have anything to do with it?
What's inside the .img file if you mount it?  An image file is an archive like iso, rar, or zip, so likely if you just extract the files from it you'll have something usable.
You can use [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) for this. For example, to center the image on a 1280x720 black background:      convert your_image.jpg -gravity center -background black -extent 1280x720 wallpaper.jpg  Doing a gradient is more difficult, but you can probably do just about anything you want with a little research. This example centers your image on a radial gradient going from the average color in your image to black:      convert -size 1280x720 radial-gradient:`convert your_image.jpg -scale 1x1\! -format '%[pixel:s]' info:-`-black bg.png; composite -gravity center your_image.jpg bg.png wallpaper.jpg  You can change the -gravity parameter if you don't want the image centered. Use 'north' for the top, 'south' for the bottom, etc. You can also do a regular gradient instead of radial, and switch (or change) the colors.  There are a ton of options. I'm not an expert, but I can try to help if there's a specific effect you're trying to get.  
You are actually right. It WAS VLC.
This worked perfectly, thanks!
It's none of those. I played it on MPC-HC and it worked perfectly. It's VLC that's causing the problem. Although you may be right about the throttling, because I think VLC uses double the CPU power of MPC, right?
I've tested it on MPC-HC and it works flawlessly. I don't know what's up with VLC lately but it has been acting up!
Looks great, I'll check it out!
Take a look at DatPlot http://www.datplot.com/
It supports RAW formats ([there's a list here](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6156099?hl=en)) and I think it processes them if you pick the unlimited storage option. If you want them to store the original it will use Google Drive space. 
I think the most feasible solution is to run the motion capture when your phone is not detected and turn it off when your phone is connected to the computer. I don't know of an all-in-one solution, so you'll have to look at using one thing to detect your phone connected and then use that to turn the motion detection on and off.  It looks like some people have used AutoHotKey to detect connected bluetooth devices.  https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/70836-any-way-to-detect-bluetooth-device-status/    
it's awesome, has greenshot's image editor built-in, can capture video, images, built-in uploader supporting multiple services, & free
Oh? Imma look into this
They are hosted on SourceForge and have gotten fairly unreliable displaying the pages. They posted a blog post update within the last week or two that explains this and also talks about the update they did recently to make the update check not hit the servers as hard. They are transitioning away from sf to resolve these issues.  Usually Refreshing (F5) the page displays your desired content.
I'll check that out. I was really hoping for something automated as well as motion detection rather than constant video. 
Thank you! I think this actually may be the best solution.  You know if the free version upload raw images, process them and then discard the raw file?
My desktop has Bluetooth which I use to connect my phone and computer primarily to use unified remote so they automatically connect to each other.   Desktop is Win 8.1 pro and phone is Samsung Galaxy Note 4 on android.

Google Photos has a [Mac uploader](https://photos.google.com/apps) and you can batch download them through [Google Takeout](https://www.google.com/settings/takeout). The search feature is mindblowing thanks to the AI image recognition.   You get unlimited space if your photos are 16 megapixels or smaller and videos 1080p and down. If you don't let Google compress them it uses the 15 GB of Google Drive space (you can buy more storage if you want). 
Also, I guess it must be able to handle iPhoto and Photos libraries.
You could try Milestone Xprotect Go, it has a dedicated server which you could turn on and off with two clicks. Up to 5 days of recording.

Are you talking about making drum beats and adding midi keyboards and stuff like that? People are listing notation software since you said "composition," but I assume you mean a multi-track DAW where you can write midi parts for drums and keyboards, etc.  If so, Ableton or Fruity Loops, which aren't free. You can test out Reaper for free which is a little more work to use their midi.
Unless you absolutely unequivocally need offline access, Google Docs.
The real issue I find with music production software is its all so diverse. Basic skills you pick up from one application will usually translate to another app, but just about everything else needs to be relearned. Thats why its sometimes better picking the software you are comfortable, and then work back to a heavily discounted edition from there.  FWIW, I think Ableton does a lot of things right for both live and prerecorded performances. Then you have CuBases and ProLogics that tend to be a little more classical arrangement editors. Anything that properly supports VST style instrument plugins is going to more or less do the trick. Just try to avoid products that lock you into proprietary synths like Reason.
It probably depends on what kind of music you imagine writing.  Here's a relevant [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_MIDI_editors_and_sequencers) (sort by license type for free ones).
IMO https://musescore.org has the smallest learning curve for a product of its quality. Great software. Totally free.

You're certainly seeing a high CPU drain. There are lots of different features the videos might have that could impact CPU performance. Determining whether you can play a video could be much more complicated than just 1080p and 10bit.  Are the 10bit videos HEVC or H.264? If they're HEVC, that's probably the reason... it's a huge CPU drain. Other potential problems include high references frame counts or certain High profile features like CAVLC, 4:4:4 Intra, high macroblock rates and more.  In any case, there might not be a lot you can do other than try to get your videos from a different source. You can try other video players or hope VLC release an update that helps your performance but the reality is that VLC is probably pretty good already, you're just trying to play overly complex video.
Of course there is a Windows binary for Gnumeric. (But be aware that, according to my own tests, Gnumeric has an awful support for most file formats.) Other that that, I love Softmaker's PlanMaker.  Why do you want a "lightweight" one by the way?

Then this is the program for you. Of course, the makers aren’t responsible for how users are going to utilize the application. It was specifically made to address a need and demand that remains strong in the hacker community; nothing more, nothing less.

That's exactly what I was going to say, haha. I'm not sure if you need Chrome DEV to do it, though. I've been on DEV since release, so I end up never knowing what's on stable and what's not...
There can be multiple issues that lead to stuttering or lagging when playing back video:  source bitrate too high with insufficient storage device bandwidth (slow hard drive vs ssd)  source MKV container codec is cpu intensive (h264 vs prores for instance(but if it's final output likely not to be prores or any intermediate codecs, which are usually easier to decode but are very high bitrate))   Afaik, You won't have the benefit of hardware decoding using nvidia or intel cpus ( http://codecs.forumotion.net/t1875-cannot-get-intel-quicksync-and-10bit-to-work-together )  The best thing you can do is probably narrow down the issue as I suggested to another user having issues with laggy decoding. https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/3lp56p/t440p_with_4k_video_jumpy/cva0xwo  maybe your cpu is being throttled, is your computer on power saving mode or high performance power profile?
I haven't exhaustively searched, but I believe most hardware decoders don't have support for anything other than 8 bit, and no more than 420, which means you can't use it in VLC or MPC, though you can check for sure if it's enabled in MPC with Ctrl+J 
Where do you think vlc gets its codecs? The answer may surprise you.

That has always struck me as a attitude that stems from the open source community. People i work with and the education i got both were really helpful in explaining the matter in layman's terms.
I think a lot of the confusion about "real programmers" comes from people equating knowing the syntax of a language to a strong computer science background.  You can get a job and do great just by knowing how to program, but it is more vocational than getting a degree in computer science. The degree should give you the skills to work in the field for a lifetime.

Programming is like painting a specific picture but with many painters telling you how and when to hold the brush correctly.... According to them.  Sometimes its good to listen to a true expert. However, a true expert of the craft isn't going to tell you are wrong. They will explain how he would of approached the problem and why.  Sometimes you just have to practice putting paint on the canvas and be creative or you will never paint anything waiting on the perfect technique.

The last few years I've been independently learning to program and the thing I've noticed most about the programmer community is a philosophy that can almost be summed up by the phrase learn it the hard way or don't bother. Obviously the whole community isn't like this I've got a lot of helpful people but there's still a lot of people who suggest newbs just start with c++ and go from there. Which is fine for people that are driven but it's just going to frustrate and drive away a lot of people.

Download it and rename the file to .zip instead of .crx then unpack it so you get a folder with all the files in it, move that folder somwhere where you won't delete it then open the Extensions tab in Chrome and enable Developer mode and after that click Load unpacked extension and point it to where you put the folder.
Unpack it? Using an archiver? And how do I run it then? 
You can unpack the .crx file and run it in developer mode.
I thought Chrome no longer allows you to just drop in extensions unless they're on the web store? Or is there some sort of work around that I'm not aware of? 
Ever wondered how free VPNs can be free? I'll help you there: because they monitor all your traffic and monetize it any way they can, the dodgier the better.

Same here! It's such a great tool.  The whole command-line interface puts a lot of people off, though. Myself included, actually. XMR is great because it goes fairly in depth about the abilities ffmpeg has. Unfortunately this means the interface is a little clunky.

[Xmedia Recode](http://xmedia-recode.de/en/) can do this.
Yes perhaps, but it depends on the operating system you're talking about. See the sidebar. 
Well, no, not exactly. As I said, I don't need (or want) all those fancy multi-media functions that are offered by OneNote and Evernote. I've used OneNote in the past, but I want as little to do with Microsoft and their recent plunge into information hoarding as possible. Same goes for Google, and to some extent, Apple (which is why I'm looking for a Notes.app replacement).  To list the big ones:  * Apple (Notes.app): yes, the functionality here is what I'm aiming at. "Trust" online is relative. * Microsoft (OneNote): No. A good program (OSX version is a bit lacking, though), but it is more than what I need, and Microsoft have completely lost my "trust". * Google (Docs): not at all what I'm looking for. Never trusted them to begin with. * Evernote: tried it. Did not like it. Too many functions and thingymabob.  The Notes.app is more or less just what I want, but I'm interested in a program that does not make me dependant on iCloud for syncing.  Google Drive/Docs have never even been considered an alternative, imo, since that would be about as practical as a bunch of Word docs (I've tried something along those lines), but I've seen that many suggests this for some reason.
So you're looking for the Google, Apple, Microsoft, Evernote functionality but without the name?

There's also a great utility called [tcplay](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tcplay) which can be combined with kpartx to mount drives containing several partitions within the same encrypted volume (full disk encryption).  With a bit of work it's possible to boot linux on a drive using truecrypt full disk encryption. (The truecrypt bootloader works well enough for grub to load the kernel, after that you'll need a ramdisk containing tcplay and kpartx to decrypt and mount the root filesystem)

You can't really do this. You want to provide internal mappings of buildings and also provide a path from current location to nearest exit. Good luck with that. Not only can I not imagine how you're going to get these building maps, you're going to want to provide minute details of location down to a couple feet which is not easy/possible especially because the quality of that service is going to be super super reliant on the quality of service that you can't control  Going beyond just the tech into the actual use experience: You don't want people looking down at their phones in buildings during scenarios like this as the top comment mentions. People are trained in this as is. The app complicates it and is likely not going to be the first thing someone will look at in an emergency.   Also, you have the issue that for large scale scenarios, you're already behind the curve to facebook notifications. You'll never beat them out on that use case.

Personally I kind of found the lack of a right click menu annoying.  Yeah it has stuff like rectangular selection, but I can't modify my selection like I can in gimp. With gimp once I make a selection, I can actually resize it and adjust it. I don't want to have to redo the entire selection.    Didn't see a clone tool, which I more often use for image editing, especially for photos that might need repairs.  No sicissors select tool that I saw. http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html  The lack of a right click menu is kinda annoying. I don't want more painting tools, I want to be able to copy and paste and do other image things.  Like I said Krita looks like a great artist program, but it's a completely different workflow then I'm used to.  Gimp has always had a horrible UI, but I don't use it for the UI, I use it for the tools.  Like I said I actually use paint.net more often, except when I need better selection tools, which Gimp's are far closer to photoshop's then Paint.net's are.  
uhhh, pretty sure it's got most if not all of the same selection tools. plus it has actual development being done on a consistent basis driven by kickstarters. People vote with money on new features, then shit gets made.
Personally I see Krita as more of an "artist" editor. If you're doing a lot of drawing or artwork I could see using Krita, but for image editing in general I prefer gimp over krita.  I usually use paint.net until I need better selection tools, then I use gimp.  That said I will pay a little more attention to Krita just to see if it would work for my purposes.
Giving it a go now, thank you!

After over an hour of experimenting, googling, and crying, I switched computers, fired up Paint.NET, and had it all done in about five minutes. I'm versed in Photoshop, which isn't exactly an *easy* tool, but it feels like the devs of Gimp have gone out of their way to make it unintuitive and impossible to use.

Ok so what I asked for (5 months ago) was an editing function with regex support.  Basically notepad++'s search-replace features ripped into a background process that functions on any highlighted text in any program. 
 How do you mean that you can't use the clipboard? Do you mean when windowspy or ^c, or other command would not be able to store the text in the clipboard? How is this different from what clipboard replace does (with some minor AutoHotkey tweaking)? I use clipboard replace in combination with Ditto (for storing the clipboard and some other features). 
First time I heard of them, but most of what they do can already be done with freeware or open source software like format factory, handbrake, fast stone image viewer...
Can anyone comment as to the quality/trustworthiness of these? Free software on a site with poor English always puts me off.
Winamp and AIMP are audio players. Musicbee is an audio manager. VLC is a video player.   Nowadays any video player can play all types of formats. If you want features, I have not seen anything more feature rich than Potplayer but do remember that features and friendly UI are often inversely proportional.  If your mobile device is IPhone, MediaMonkey (I don't recommend this) and MusicBee can sync music with IPhone. On Android, you don't need any of this.
I use Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Connection Manager](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44989) to connect to 10 servers that I manage and it works pretty well

Winamp might be a good choice (although we still wait for a new release since Radionomy who bought it from AOL has not made a new version yet). If you are impatient, try [AIMP](http://aimp.ru) which resembles Winamp in some ways but uses a different sound engine (BASS).

It's entirely dependent on how much your drivers "enhance" your audio. If the drivers are good, they should sound the same as if you're using WASAPI/ASIO.
not sure really, too many contradicting statement all around. Some say wasapi bypass windows audio so it sounds way better, some say windows improved their audio. So I post here to ask.

It's using the exact same encoder as ShadowPlay if you select NVENC. Set the bit rate the same as ShadowPlay and it should be no different.   If you're losing 30fps that's ridiculous even for x.264 encoding, OBS by default runs at a low CPU priority and should start dropping frames of it's own before it makes a large impact in other processes. Still, NVENC

I5-2500k 4Ghz, GTX 970, 8gb RAM, 500gb HDD. I actually didn't change anything with bitrates etc., because I don't know what numbers to put in so I guess it's on default 1k or something. I wasn't looking into it because after I saw such FPS drop I gave up :P I'll try different encoder then. Thanks! :D
I was using [mremoteNG](http://www.mremoteng.org/), but project seems dead. You can look at [Terminals](https://terminals.codeplex.com/). But if you don't mind paying a little, best option is [RoyalTS](http://www.royalapplications.com/ts/win/download), which is awesome, if you have to manage several servers. I bought it rather than [Remote Desktop Manager](http://remotedesktopmanager.com/), but you can try it too.
What's your hardware specs? There's probably something wrong with your settings. If you have a supporting CPU you can try using Quick Sync instead of x264, or since you have an nvidia gpu you can use NVENC.   The quality is definately because of your settings. What bitrate are you using?
Sadly, I lose like 30 FPS with OBS and quality isn't that great...
OBS can do that, and it's free.  https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-use-the-replay-buffer.103/
Jitbit Macro Recorder is your friend:  https://www.jitbit.com/macro-recorder/  It's MUCH easier to use than AutoHotKey, and it can turn pretty much any problem you have into a straightforward thing to do. You have screenshot software? You have file upload software? Jitbit Macro Record is the glue that puts it all together.   The only downside is that it pretty much owns the computer, but there are ways around that. For example, I use both Jitbit Macro Recorder and AutoHotKey, and when I want them to do something without totally dedicating a PC to it, I have them freeze the mouse and keyboard, switch to the window they need, do their thing, and then release the mouse and keyboard. It interrupts me only as long as they need to do their job.  Another downside is that AutoHotkey is free, but Jitbit Macro Recorder is not free. It's worth the money though. I've tested a lot of such things, and it's by far the best. Plus, if you have a blog or some other semi-important website, it's still possible to get a free copy of Jitbit Macro Recorder just by linking back to them:  https://www.jitbit.com/macro-recorder/free-macro-recorder/  I'm guessing it must be better than paying for advertising, which makes sense.
thank you
ViceVersa is the best backup software I have found, specifically because it does a great job of exactly the use case you have. It will automatically detect when files change, back them up, and timestamp or "archive" all versions. It's very powerful, but the company doesn't respond well to bug reports, and they don't even allow screenshots to be posted on their forum. Fortunately, you have to push the software hard to like I do to find a bug, because it's very polished. I don't pay for much of my software, but ViceVersa is worth every penny:  http://www.tgrmn.com/  Backup is useless without data integrity checks, and ViceVersa is one of the few that can at least do a checksum to verify the file was copied correctly. I won't even bother with backup software that can't do a simple checksum. That rules out all but maybe 5 or 6 of them. Get MultiPar and Corz Checksum too, they're handy.  Get the latest version of MultiPar here:  https://www.livebusinesschat.com/smf/index.php?board=396.0  Corz Checksum here:  http://corz.org/windows/software/checksum/
Not really about noticing, more like, not caring anymore, when a developer takes a year to release a revision version, people tend to either uninstall, or forget about checking for new versions and continue using the software if it is stable. I stopped at 9.25, checking the log, 9.30 came out a year later and it wasnt even a major version, just a small revision, I simply rolled with 9.25 and didnt bother to check anymore after a while, I assumed the software was done as is i.e fulfilled the dev's needs, and I wasn't having any issues so...   Then looking at the history, 9.33 took 6 months from 9.32, then 9.35 6 months from 9.34 and the here and there 6 month gaps. I guess it's safe to say that, it's been more than a year and a half since I discarded checking the website.
I personally use "Disconnect" on Chrome, I don't think they are on other browsers. They are more transparent than ghostery ,at least from what I read.
Am still using chrome, with 40-100+ tabs open sometimes.   However recently(like the past month) , I noticed chrome sometimes are covered with black boxes all over(even with just 4 tabs open), and I need to scroll up down to make pages look normal again(I gt 16gb ram,and I never use more than 12gb ram at any time).   Been considering switch to other browsers, but not sure firefox or Opera. Seems like both of those browsers have problems of their own too..
Now you have a lifetime of regret of not having purchased MSFT stock instead with the same money. 
People don't give them enough credit in this area. MS has always blown away everyone else on support and backwards compatibility. Hell, did you know you can still compile and run some DOS programs on current Windows? I can't even run some java or mac programs from last year!   People automatically write off all of Microsoft's success in the 90's as dirty tricks. That definitely was a big part of it, but they also courted developers like crazy and have the best dev tools in the business. Anyone who has used VS can back me up here.  We still have 2 programs running Windows Forms with components I wrote in 2005. Literally. The new customer form I added is sill the original when I first started the program.   Meanwhile, our java programs break with every update. We just had all our java client programs break bc Java removed the medium security setting which was the default before. The update before that they changed the way security was done so it required all jars to be signed and some of our dependencies weren't so it broke all our java clients that time also. The time before that, a java update broke the default Glassfish class path. Netbeans won't properly open my swing program gui bc swing app framework is dead. Seriously? Already? One fucking thing after another with java.   Apple wont let you even add apps or updates to the store that aren't fully compliant with the latest versions.  Everyone knows the python 2 -> 3 debacle.  JavaScript looks like someone shattered a window with all the pieces that don't work together. ES6? ES7? TS? CoffeeScript? Wtf  Meanwhile, the first form in the first program I ever wrote in Windows Forms keeps chugging along.  That is why MS was so popular in the 90's, and still is today.   They have always had long term support. Other companies are only now catching up by offering 10 year LTS. MS has had 10 year LTS from the beginning.  Edit: Formatting

It's always best to update the drivers from the official manufacturers website but if you just want some quick piece of software there is "snappy driver"  http://snappy-driver-installer.sourceforge.net/en/index.php or driver pack solution http://drp.su/uk/  They mostly work well but with Windows 10 now most drivers are auto installed anyway.
Sorry I can't help you more, but you haven't given much info.  
Hmmm then I'm not sure how to stop said program from freezing, ;(
If you can open them in any image viewer, then they are probably ok.
You need to be more specific about what aspect of the history you want to visualize.  i.e. visualizing just the dates of edits, the amount of data added/removed, how many different editors, etc
I was thinking military but yeah, I could see banking too.
Maybe patches for Y2K on some weird "this big bank never bothered to upgrade" software?
Sure, but because they've been releasing those interim builds it's obvious the project wasn't abandoned. 
Some people don't want to use alpha or beta software.
I use WinRAR with the professional theme, icons look super nice.
I came to post the same thing.  I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around that.  Seriously?  They still supported 1.0 in ***2000*** ???
I tested several times Google Chrome (all channel of development), but nothing I do not like it.  Using Firefox on all operating systems without addons and no flash player (not surf on sites with flash player).  I noticed that at parity of open pages, counting all the processes of Chrome, Chrome uses much more RAM than Firefox.
I'm glad no one told me that 10 years ago.
> Unsupported as of December 31st 2001  14 years ago, MS was supporting their first version of Windows?
30 years is a good time to stop.
What more do you want? It's about as barebones as it gets, which I think is a good thing.
Yes. That is correct mainly because Windows makes it hard to access partitions directly, especially when not an admin. Windows doesn't treat it like a normal file line Linux does.
No clue, sorry.
I remember buying it as soon as I could because ... for a limited time ... it was bundled with an extensive library of free software: notepad, paint, calculator, solitaire, etc.  With a deal like that - all that free software - you've got to act fast or live with a lifetime of regret.
Not yet.

Oh, that explains it. I was just thinking... "huh, seems like I haven't updated 7 zip for years."
The ext* thing is pretty awesome considering the other ext* software I've tried on Windows has been really buggy in the past.  Although from my first look in 7z, it looks like you need the filesystem to be in an image file?  There's no way to open a HDD partition directly?
I guess you never noticed all those alpha and beta releases? 
[Rainmeter](http://www.rainmeter.net/) is probably what you're looking for. It has tons of options and skins, and is completely customizable, with a little work.

A company owner constantly wonders what they can do to influence the buyer to buy from them instead of their competitor. If you also have this concern, then incorporate web chat software on your web site and resolve their queries online and track them on real-time basis. 
Well if it was at least functional. But it isnt. 
That was my reaction after noticing that the new version still does not unpack .tgz in one go - see the [epic thread](http://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/discussion/45797/thread/5eb1b8d5).

There's a whole lot in there if you haven't bothered with alphas or betas, given how long time it was since last release.  Here are some big things I found (since 9.20):  * Defaulting to LZMA2. This has arbitrary multithreading support for compression and decompression as its main feature, besides handling partially incompressible files much better. Combined with speed optimizations for large archives, this is bound to cause noticeable speed improvements for multicore systems. * The GUI can now move files to archives + corresponding option in the Add dialog reachable via context menu. * Multivolume self-extracting 7z archive support. * WinRAR 5 (RAR5) archive support. * WinZip .zipx support (with xz compression). * > 4 GB file support in ISO's. * Better 7z compression in Max/Ultra for EXE/DLL's. * Console version uses stderr for errors = more usable logging / scripting. * Besides ext2, ext3, ext4, vmdk image support, also WIM, GPT, single file QCOW2, VDI images.  Edit: Another one!  * CRC-32, CRC-64, SHA-1, SHA-256 calculation for files via the context menu! That'll be useful for me.

WinRAR 5 is way prettier and quite a lot faster than 7zip.
The file icons are literally folders from windows 95 with an ugly 7 overlay.
The interface is horrible, but do you really need an eyecandy to extract an archive? It should be functional, first of all. Beauty comes later.
nice
Auslogics have one. Not free though.
That's one of the nice things about it. No bullshit, only performance. Like when WinAmp got all crazy with all the skins in WinAmp3 and people switched to Foobar.
No brotli support yet? :)
Literally never seen the GUI for this app. Entirely use through the context menu.
my reaction after categorizing 7zip year and a half ago as an app that was probably abandoned or that the dev didnt give a crap anymore, but was still nicely useful, http://i.imgur.com/kePjL5R.gif
Oooh, I didn't even notice that!
Sorry, I totally missed that your platform was Windows7. That is a shame.

Yeah, plz upgrade the interface. Its horrible.
It took 5 years and it still looks like it was made for Windows 95.

You're welcome!  No idea if this helps, and maybe you've done this already...but if you log the input you get and you go to the dev(s) who wrote the code that generate that input, you could show them the logs. It might wery well be that seeing the differences in the input will allow them to deduce what's going wrong in their code. Even if you can't fix it yourself...just by documenting what is going on you are helping. The better you can document what is going on - even if you don't fully understand it - the easier it will be for them to figure out the underlying issue.   And generally speaking...yes, you will more than likely be expected to do these things in your future career as software developer. To which extent depends on your job. To expand on what I said... there's jobs where this is basically all you do all day. There's jobs where you have to do it every now and then. Then there's jobs where you're really only expected to do the first part...you get assigned an issue, and if you find the underlying problem originates from a different part of the code you pass it on to the person responsible for that code (who in turn may do the same, until the underlying issue is found and fixed). There's also jobs where you only do this with the most critical of issues because your time is so valuable that someone else will be assigned to fix these things, and possibly even your own (less critical) bugs - but these kinds of jobs you won't get unless you're on a very good senior level.   You could also venture into a more architecture heavy role, where you're more concerned with designing complex systems on a higher level and leave the actual implementation to others - but it's generally a good idea to focus on pure development first and gradually move to architecture if this is something you find interesting. To be a good software architect you better be a good developer as well, at least that's what I found.   If you're good and the company is growing (or there's some turnover), you may be offered a team lead/technical lead type position. Then you'll be the one deciding who gets to work on what on your team ;) And from there it's not a far jump into middle management if you're so inclined - but this is a whole different ballgame, with its own set of challenges and rewards.   So if you ever do get stuck in a position where you hate what you're doing most of the day...don't let it get to a point where you begin to hate software development. Software development is a huge field and all companies are different. If you ever get to that point and your situation allows it, don't be afraid to jump ship and find a job at another company (which incidentally can also be a great salary booster). You'll find that most companies will want to instill a sense of loyalty - but don't be fooled. Of course they do this for their own benefit, which is fair enough if the loyalty goes both ways. You should find out quickly if that's the case. Sadly, most of the time it is not...but don't let that dishearten you. Instead, use it to your advantage. After all, why should you be loyal to an entity who is not loyal to you?  Just don't be an ass about it (unless you want to...I mean, if upper management is your eventual goal then being a ruthless asshole can be quite an asset). But if you're professional, honest, competent and a good communicator you can go a loooong way while still maintaining your integrity. I guess it's all about what you want out of this career!  Didn't mean to rant on there, sorry...but I'll post it anyway, maybe you can get something out of it. 
Fun fact: Last *official* release was 5 years ago plus a day on top of that (not counting beta versions, etc).
Oh shit! Opening ext2, ext3, ext4, and vmdk images?! That's awesome!
Defiantly a Scam  * First it presents you with the Option to Express install, or you can do Custom Install. Which you are then presented with this: http://i64.tinypic.com/15dw39s.jpg    * Then if you try to Uncheck any of them it gives you this silly Box:   http://i63.tinypic.com/vpkpzc.jpg    * If you manage to Uncheck all those boxes, you are then presented with.......You guessed it. More "Offers". Hence this:   http://i63.tinypic.com/55fja9.jpg    * After all that, this pops up in your taskbar:   http://i66.tinypic.com/2ltq0jo.jpg    After it's all said and done. It just quits...Nothing is then "Installed" (If you cancelled all the Offers), No Icon, Nothing at all. It is basically a Junk Installer. I tried "Installing" the one that's Exampled here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gKN0DyUaLs    So just like nlweb said. If it's to good to be true, it usually is. 
Thanks for the response!  I'm certain my code is working, the problem isn't that the results are incorrect, it's that the other code puts in what *should* be the same info multiple times, but it doesn't get the same info out.   As for whether he's being an ass, I do not think he is. Many, many interns have all worked on this project, which is great, but that also means there's essentially a shit storm of code everywhere. For instance, there is a function that is a purposeful misspelling of another function, and it returns the result of executing that other function, because someone was too lazy to fix their misspelling somewhere else in code.  I think nobody knows what's going on and nobody feels like/has the time to fix it due to other things. I'm expected to fix it by Monday.... eh. I'm pretty certain that I will not be able to fix it, there is so much going on in it that I have no experience with. It's like trying to defuse a bomb as a chef.  My main purpose in asking this question, I guess, is that I want to know what to do if I get in this situation later down the road. Once I've worked on a few projects and have some experience, vs "this will totally be a good learning experience!", am I still going to be expected to do these things?   But you've answered that. Thanks again
> Who's responsibility is it to fix?  Short answer: generally, whoever is responsible for the code that contains a bug is responsible for fixing that bug.  Loger answer: If you can demonstrate that your code is correct (for example, by writing unit tests that show your code meets whatever requirements you were given) then this is a case of "bullshit in, bullshit out". If your code gets incorrect input then it will produce incorrect output.  If this is the case (which it may not be...there's still a chance you missed a bug in your code), someone needs to find the place where the bullshit input ultimately originates from and figure out why it's bullshit. Who is responsible for this kind of debugging work really depends on the way your team is set up. Sometimes there'll be one or two devs who know the codebase really well and would be able to find the bug much quicker than anyone else on your team. Sometimes everyone is super busy with other higher priority tasks so it's left to a junior to have a crack at. And so on...there's so many ways this could go depending on the severity of the issue, current workload, your team, company, individual people, etc.  In this case, it seems you'll be stuck with it no matter what so your next step would be to narrow this down (how exactly depends on details that I cannot deduce from the information you gave here) and find out who wrote the code from which the bullshit input emerges. If you understand why the input is bullshit and know where it is coming from, it will be that much harder for the responsible developer to argue that you're responsible for fixing it.   If he's still asking you to fix it, then...well... do you think he's asking you to do it because he's an ass and you're "just" an intern, or because he thinks this will be a good learning experience for you and allow you to get a deeper understanding of the overall codebase?  Then there's the question of are you even able to fix it? It might be such a tricky bug that the fix would require knowledge about his code or the whole codebase that you lack, and that you cannot acquire on your own in a reasonable amount of time given your experience and position.  Personally, I would use this as an opportunity to practice your debugging and troubleshooting skills - an excellent developer not only writes "good code" but is also an expert in debugging and troubleshooting code, both his and that of others. Just see how far you get. If you fix it, great. If not, tell your boss(es) you gave it your best shot but were unfortunately unable to fix it.

You don't necessarily need to use CR for this. Setup read only credentials on the database and have a custom application pull the data in real time if you want. Or use existing credentials - just make sure the app is secure with HTTPS even if it is internal because what it connects to is sensitive information.   Getting a screenshot would work but it's not the most intuitive way of doing it.

Cool. I'll use this for future reference. I'm glad I bought it and all, but I just went ahead and torrented audio files so i could listen to it on my computer.  I wish audible would just upgrade the windows program instead of ignoring what i imagine would be a large part of its customer base.
I have a CAD (computer aided dispatch) program that I have a few licenses for. I'd like to screenshot the program and put that screenshot out onto the intranet for others to see. That way, everyone can see the call, location, status, and unit assigned without having the program on the computer. It's not for mission critical users (thus the 30 or 60 second screenshot), just for ones to know whats going on if they wanted to look. I don't think its violating any licenses or terms, we're just sending a screenshot of the program out to a network drive. 
You could set up an Auto Hotkey to do this,  but I have to ask,  why? 
I don't think such a madness.

It's a question of personal preference, I think. I like the layout, vecor graphics, consitent fonts within plots of TeX, but I also like to actually see a table or a formula while editing. LyX reasonably limits what you can do (e.g. it is not possible to put two spaces between words, multiplie line breaks, etc.), so you really apply the tex-logics in a more visual way. If you want to include some raw tex code at some place, you can to that anywhere within your document (I used that for a \resizebox for example).
Seconded. Tried every windows editor I could find, have used this one for every document I've written since starting grad school. 
Using a wysiwym editor for LaTeX is like asking to order off the menu at a Chinese buffet. I mean, you *can*, but if that's what you want to do you probably shouldn't be there (using TeX) in the first place.

Ublock (if you don't like ads), Flashblock (if you don't like Flash), and there's one called Nuke Anything Enhanced, where you can right click on something in a web page and select 'remove this object' - handy for when there's floating crap you want to get rid of. Also, Tabmix Plus for enhanced tabbed browsing (though I haven't used this one in a while).  Ghostery for privacy, but I don't use it.
I was thinking of switching to firefox as well. Are there any add-ons you recommend?
Depends on who you ask. Some people say they jumped from Chrome to Firefox because Chrome was getting too bloated, and some went the other way for the same reason. I personally prefer Firefox myself, if for no other reason than it is a bit more configurable out of the box. And there's always Safari on Mac, but I'm a Windows user so wouldn't know anything about that.
Ah, you can do that without any third party software  http://www.howtogeek.com/112050/how-to-turn-your-windows-8-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/
I need to make a hotspot on my laptop so my iPhone can get WiFi.
No [Therac-25?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25) It's a classic when discussing safety in embedded engineering. 
The iOS app does this too. Options are 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x, 2.5x, and 3x. I usually stick to 1.25 or 1.5, depending on how slowly the narrator speaks, and if I'm going to be listening for a long time I tick the speed up a notch every so often until it's maxed out. It's kind of amazing how your brain gets accustomed to the speed changes. 
Doesn't iOS have a built in hotspot like android?
nice
You might get more ideas from  /r/Android 
Depends on the tool. Each one works differently
The Audible app for Android has a setting where you can change the speed.  See http://audible.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4795/~/how-can-i-adjust-the-playback-speed-in-the-audible-for-android-app%3F for more details.
OmniPage can do this.
so you are saying there may be a.... gap in the market ?   lol   It's a Shame as ACDSee pretty much nails it, but it keeps crashing, don't think it's fully compat with Win 7/8 and the latest ACDSee have lost the plot.
Why do you _need_ it free? Who owes you that favour? Just buy CheVolume.
That is getting to a pretty specific use case that might be hard to find software that does.  If I was trying to solve this, I would probably write a script or simple program in PowerShell, PHP or such that monitored the folder and then called some image viewer program to actually display the images. But, that wouldn't get you the thumbnail view of all images.
Yeah, in a word.   Don't need editing feature, it's more monitoring/viewing.   I tried Xnview again, it actually does it to a certain extent there is option for selecting newest file, but I can't put my finger on what I don't like about it It may have been some kind of compatibility thing in previous testing. Maybe just the general interface , it needs a 'light version'.  Anyway yeah, the ideal would be thumbnails, and a 'preview' window of the newest files added. major extra bonus points if the preview can show the most recent file x2 i.e. left and right pages.
I believe Microsoft OneNote would be able to do this.
I agree with other poster. This seems pretty niche so not sure you'll find something premade (unless you try to adapt a work scheduling or doctor scheduling system).  I would think at a minimum a spreadsheet would be better that word document so you could at least auto add the minutes up and possibly make use of the built-in charts.
So, you mention a lot of different things and features you like of different viewers, but am I correct in that what you are looking for is a program that will display the most recent image added to a folder, with regex rules applied?  Or are you looking for a great image viewer/editor/etc that also does the above?

Have checked out fastpicture viewer, and blimey It is indeed fast. Throws around 50 MB + tiffs like they are 20KB jpgs.   Doesn't really do what I need though in this case, but could be very useful for image review.  As for lightroom, could be too much weight, really just a basic monitor app, don't need (or want) The heft of LR behind it.
nice
A technicality I guess.  I'm not a lawyer, but if someone pushed the definition hard enough, who knows  I don't think the law has been tested in that capacity.....Then it goes by case law.  Best not to test those waters.  There are "in a nutshell" type guides that summarize what you can and cannot do.....
i actually started doing it a lot recently, after purchasing a bunch of dvd's recently.  still, not expecting to do so on regular basis in the future.

Sounds like you need a simple mail merge. You can have the data set in an excel spreadsheet and have a word document with the field names. It will take a bit of work to set it up, but once you have it done, it is a couple of clicks in Word and you have the form all filled out. Just do a google search for mail merge. I think you can even do them in Google sheets and Google docs for free. 
both look interesting indeed.  Hadn't considered using Lightroom before in the work flow.

I've had horrible luck with dvdfab for a while now. It used to work great, now I'm lucky if it can read 1/10 discs. I've tried with old discs, new discs, three different drives, two computers and vm.   Plus I had them randomly cancel my (lifetime) license saying I had asked my bank to cancel the transaction. My bank had never heard of that request, I didn't remember making it, and even though DVDFab said they gave me a refund, my bank account didn't reflect it. They were horrific in their "help."
Thanks everyone! I'll check these all out later.
> They're dumbed down to the level of someone that would do something like use a male-male cable to record audio from a computer.  That's meee!!!   Thnks
No, scroll down that page I linked and you'll find the download link.  You'll have to give them a valid email address to send you the key, but that is all you need to do.  I did this with the last offer they had, back in the summer and got the full program.  I used a secondary email address I have at GMX.com
YMMV.  Will these help?  http://www.fastpictureviewer.com/  http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/folder-watch if you're a Lightroom user.

Wouldn't it just be the same as when the nurse calls your name into the waiting room? Like the program wouldn't have any access to records, just a text box for the secretary to change what's displayed on screen.
Hmm. I'm pretty sure there's more than one. 
The software is called "virtual audio cable", But it's a cunt.  You have to buy a licence otherwise it will scare the fuck out of you and potentially render any audio work you're doing useless by pumping the word "SAMPLE" poorly rendered, at max volume through ALL output devices. 10/10 devs. 
At one time there were audio drivers out there which would simply tee an audio out to an audio in. But I haven't looked in a while. 
>I would simply plug the headphone jack into the microphone jack and then hit record in Audacity.   >>in Audacity. [^^^Toppest ^^^of ^^^^all ^^^keks](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/o/image/1403/23/1403233223539.gif)  Haha, what the fuck?   Depending on hardware you should have a stereo mix option available. You're going to want to follow these instructions to find out if you do. They're dumbed down to the level of someone that would do something like use a male-male cable to record audio from a computer.   1. Use the *mouse* to *right click* with the *cursor* on the *windows audio icon*.    ^right ^clicking ^is ^like ^clicking, ^but ^with ^the ^button ^on ^the ^*other* ^*side*.  2. *click* on **"Recording Devices"** (without quotation marks.)  3. *right click* on the middle area where devices are listed and ensure you are also viewing disabled and disconnected devices. When these are selected, a *tick* will appear on the *right click menu*.   4. Now might be a good time to take a break and maybe get some more tea. This computering business is pretty difficult.   5. If "Stereo Mix" is listed, right click it and press enable. (**TIP**: This will be our third right-click of the session. If your finger starts to tire, perhaps consider using a different one.)  6. you can now use Stereo mix as a recording device the same as any microphone. Select it as your default in windows or in whatever program you're using.    Also, if you're using audacity, it has this fucking feature built in. hit the fucking dropdown literally to the left of playback and recording device selection and hit windows wasapi. you can now select your playback device as a recording device. 
Guys like you make the world go 'round. God Bless

+1 for ShareLaTeX (for the occasional LaTeX document), Emacs otherwise.
Have a look at LyX. It is a WYSIWYM editor (what you see is what you mean), somewhere between TeX-code and full WYSIWIG. I use it all the time. You get the nice rendering of LaTeX but a nicer interface, much easier tables, formulas, etc. LyX can generate LaTeX code, however the other way round is not working too well.

I have Sublime configured to run the build command on save and additionally to save when it loses focus.

Most maps in books are drawn either by hand or with art/design software. I'd go with vector art so Inkscape would be a good choice.  Maps in the real world are drawn either in vector art packages or with GIS software, but isn't GIS overkill for what you need? 
I use TexStudio. I haven't used LaTeX on Linux, so can't compare, but I've tried quite a few windows LaTeX editors and it seems like the best one.

Are you looking for software to just render your markup? Or a full on WYSIWYG editor?
I apologize if I sounded condescending, that was not at all my intent.  Personally I'm all for using re-purposed old technology that would otherwise end up in a landfill; which is why I have a pile of old laptops in my studio.  I appreciate your reply.    The solution from /u/StoleAGoodUsername looks like it is going to work for me. 
Here at the college I work for we use a software called Qless. Sounds just like what you're looking for: http://www.qless.com/
No need to be condescending. And I don't think you understand what I am suggesting if you don't think this kind of setup can be "managed from their Macs". The laptops serve as essentially dumb terminals, their only purpose is to run the display on the TVs. Where the images they display come from, who cares. Could be a server, could be software, whatever. And they are hidden behind the TVs, so I don't see what this has to do with what the office looks like.  How you build the image that gets displayed is totally up to you. I suggested a Windows option because it's what I'm most familiar with, but you can use whatever software and formats you want. The laptops are just the display driver, they can run whatever OS and software you want.  If you want to waste money paying for sleek little boxes or Smart TVs, it's your budget, go for it. The concept is exactly the same. Or if you want to get a bunch of long HDMI cables run from one central computer, then go ahead and do that. But I figured that was no-go since you said nothing was allowed on the walls.
You rock!

That is really not going to fly at this office. [Here are some photos from inside the clinic.](http://www.spaceandstory.com/biomorphic/)  While I understand what you are suggesting, they are going to want something that they can manage from their Macs, not a hacked up version of something.  
[Have fun](https://github.com/CPCookieMan/takeanumber)  Interface is just HTML and CSS, so add stuff, remove stuff, whatever you like. This could also easily be modified to allow for the next patient's name to be displayed, just let me know.
ohh, lol. I totally misunderstood things.
If you can get your hands on some cheap (free) laptops that are otherwise useless, [you can probably do something like this](http://lifehacker.com/5919619/mount-your-laptop-to-your-tv-for-a-truly-hidden-home-theater-pc). The laptops should have WiFi, so networking is taken care of. You can set up VNC or remote desktop or whatever so that you can manage them more conveniently. All you'll need is a way to connect the power adapter and a short display cable to the TV.  After that, it's just a matter of configuring each laptop to display the data you want on screen in a loop, and pull the number you need from whatever server you need to pull it from. This might be as simple as running the powerpoint presentation like you already do, or a looping video, or something equally straightforward. Then add a simple utility like [customdesktoplogo](http://customdesktoplogo.wikidot.com/) to display an image in the corner with the "Now serving: x" number you want. The laptops don't need to be the same specs or anything, it's not like they need to do any heavy lifting computationally.
That model supports scan-to-network which is by far the easiest way to handle it.  Make a share on your computer or a network server and point the printer at it; everything you scan shows up as a PDF.  Easy.  If you don't want to handle it that way, you can tell windows about your scanning device and then it will show up in the windows scanning software to handle.

Right.  That is exactly the sort of thing that I am looking for.
Precisely.

All of the receptionists are sitting behind iMacs and your simple solution sounds like exactly what I'm looking for. 
Links to software to be able to do this would be great!
I'm curious about this as well. I'd like to achieve the same results as OP. 
To do this you will have to reconnect the TV to a PC, allow that to be the master to stream to it, running cables or using something like a Chromecast to broadcast to the TV. once you do this you need to make sure that whoever is running it is trained in how to reconnect to the TV when it goes down, etc. Not a huge issue, but puts the human factor into the equation.

Because the clinic is shared by three docs, there is a desire to keep everyone happy. There is also a strict "nothing affixed to the wall" policy; hence why I want to avoid using a numbering system.  Really what I am thinking about is an RSS feed with the number of the next patient discreetly in the corner of the screen.  
I could easily write something like this. If all of the receptionists will have the computer nearby, I can have them press the space bar to advance the number and make a chime sound. Otherwise I can do a slightly more complex web system where they can press a button on their computer to advance it.
There are a number of systems and software out there, most likely the two you would look at would be a physical spool with numbers and a separate board that keeps track, or you would have to use the entire TV to broadcast the software based versions. I personally would look into the first and not worry about using the whole TV for it. 
I'm sure the power point isn't a take a number system. It's probably just information about the office doctors, etc.

Well, this seems like similar database software I've tried with through alternatives like Microsoft and LibreOffice.   I've tried using both, and I'm not particularly good at it; moreover, between my inability to create awesome looking forms yet, and the lack of a polished end-user interface, the school is unwilling to try and implement it.   :/
